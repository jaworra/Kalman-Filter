Forecasting the commodity value is a challenging process due to the stochastic non-linear
nature of the financial market. While there have been a number studies on statistical and
filtering techniques for stock market prediction, this paper improves on the current literature
by investigating the novel development of Kalman filters techniques applied to iron ore
prices.

The forecasting capabilities of Kalman filters are studied and compared to traditional
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The comparison was
conducted through the efficient modelling and forecasting of monthly commodity prices of
iron ore over 30 years.

The study signifies the important role of parameter estimates obtained in both ARIMA and
the Kalman process when devising optimal approaches to forecasting long term iron ore
prices. Results of the study will show the best performing models obtained by comparison of
statistical performance metrics and the potential in developing automatic prediction system
for commodity prices, patterns and volatility in the economic sector for applications such as
risk management, asset pricing and allocation.
